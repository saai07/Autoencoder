# Autoencoder

This project implements an Autoencoder an unsupervised deep learning model used for data compression, noise reduction, and feature extraction. The autoencoder learns to encode input data into a lower-dimensional latent representation and then reconstruct the original input from this compressed version.

#ðŸ“Œ Features
Encoder-Decoder architecture using TensorFlow

Works on image datasets like MNIST 

Support for Denoising Autoencoder

Latent space visualization

Training and evaluation scripts
